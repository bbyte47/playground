He got up on the roof and cut all the branches that were touching the home which turned out to be more than expected. Then he removed the flashing from the roof to the porch.
And completed by blowing off all the pine needles that had accumulated on the roofs.

    <p>A Beginner’s Guide to ETFs: Choosing Your First Exchange-Traded Fund Introduction to ETFs Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have become increasingly popular as a versatile investment option for both novice and seasoned investors. An ETF is a type of investment fund that is traded on stock exchanges, much like individual stocks. ETFs typically aim to track the performance of a specific index, commodity, or a basket of assets. This allows investors to gain exposure to a broad market or sector without having to buy each individual security.

It is amazing how fast our power was restored, and the crews must work in some unsuitable weather. The power companies do a good job of bringing in crews from other areas that have not been hit. But still it is not only a hard job but there is a lot of risk involved.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">Ice Storm
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>February 22 Steuben County Indiana had a significant ice storm where the location had 2.35 inches of rain that turned into some cases of 1/2 inch of ice that weighed on trees causing the loss of limbs and in some cases entire trees fell down. With this type of destruction, the area also lost power and there are some locations still without power.
Our property trees don’t do well in icestorms even when it is relatively minor, so this storm was catastrophic for us. We have several large trees that haven’t been bothered much before that lost most of their limbs. In the past we have used that area for pens having over the years goats, ponies, chickens, and dogs that lived there. It sure is good that no one lives there now as it is a disaster there now. This is a picture looking into that area. This picture doesn’t do a good job of showing the limbs that are down plus it is taken over the stump that was left from the 3rd tree that used to be there that we lost due to a mini tornado. If you look closely, you might recognize a large limb in the background and in the foreground just slightly to the right and going into the picture is another large limb. On the extreme right snf in the lower area are landscape railroad ties that are stored there.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Taking a break from the Human Family and wanted to talk about installing Nextcloud on an Ubuntu-Server. Got the idea from a feed on Google News where this woman did just this. Her reason for doing this was being concerned about security as she is an author and didn’t want her work to become plagiarized. With the advent of AIchat scrapping information from the internet and then presenting it to a user she was concerned that storing her information on any cloud device could be vulnerable. Don’t share her concerns as first am not anywhere close to her abilities and secondly don’t feel like private cloud repositories are open to that type of scrapping. But she went into detail about creating a cloud storage system on her private network at home.

    <p>Starter Site begins with installing Hugo on your developing computer. You can use all the popular platforms Windows, Apple, or Linux. Go to gohugo.io and you will find on the home page instructions for installing Hugo on your platform. If you plan on working with SASS then make sure you install the extended version. Once installed run this command: hugo version and you should get back something like this: Hugo Static Site Generator v0.80.0/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-12-31T20:02:59Z. As an aside you will notice that I am using Linux while most online web instuctors use a Mac which is kind of counter intuitive since most web servers run on Linux.

    <p>First Post is an introduction for this site. A key reason for starting this site is to put into practice what I have been learning concerning using Hugo. This is taken from their website: Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.
Not so sure that the fun part really jumps out since there has always been enjoyment for me creating websites. For me it is more a certain type of familiarity as it reminds me of previous work with Wordpress. Just a good way to get a website up without having to jump through a lot of hoops.
