Possibly, if had read the book would have had a different take on it. Am comfortable in all the different types of media from print, digital, and audible. They all have different benefits and I switch between all three; at the moment more focused on audible. Found the book okay but not one that I would ever read again.

    <p> Foreword Took a shortcut today and asked ChatGPT to produce this article about the book Hail Mary by Andy Weir that I recently finished for the 2nd time. And the story that ChatGPT did is a really nice job about not revealing any plot reveals. This has become one of my all-time favorite books. And yes, am aware of the criticism about a lot of the science not holding up. If one reads a fictional book, imagining the possibility and storytelling suffices. Even reading a tech book, one can find errors. For me the book excels in every area and I highly recommend getting it.

    <p>Creating a Todo app with Electron using SQLite as the database. Have taken several courses on Electron from Udemey and done the walk-through tutorial that the Electron site has. The tutorial did a nice job of not only being easy to follow but also worked and was able to create a desktop app for Windows 11 that would open to a Hello page.
Then decided to do a simple Todo app as it is something that so many people include in their training portfolio as it does have something that uses CRUD and displays data. As I was sticking with Electron tried to search for examples using both Google and YouTube with not a lot of success. It could have been that I was looking for examples using SQLite as the database. Was kind of stuck on SQLite as it is something that I am familiar with and works well with this type of project. Did find a resource on YouTube but started getting ino issues and the work arounds started becoming a headache.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence language model developed by OpenAI that can interact with users through natural language conversations. It has been trained on a vast dataset of text from the internet, including business-related sources, such as financial reports, news articles, and industry publications, to provide users with accurate and helpful responses to their queries.
As a business professional, you may find ChatGPT to be a useful tool for answering questions related to finance, marketing, management, and other areas of business. Additionally, ChatGPT can assist with tasks such as data analysis, market research, and generating ideas for business plans. However, it’s essential to note that ChatGPT is still an AI model and may not always provide perfect responses, so it’s important to use it as a supplement to your own expertise and knowledge.
