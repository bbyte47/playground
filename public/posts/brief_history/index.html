  "articleBody": "Brief History is a course that I took taught by Dr. Yuval Noah Harari back around 2013 and since then a book “Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind” was produced and has been translated into several languages. It is about human history from around 70,000 years ago to the 21st Century. As Dr Harami himself says it is both superficial and controversial. The course is divided into 20 segments and even with the book there is no way that it can explore any subject in any detail. Once looking ahead in the course saw a section on Building Pyramids and naturally assumed that he would be discussing ancient Egypt which never came up rather he used that to bring up social order which as he describes it as a story the whole group believes in. He now discusses objective, subjective, and inter subjective. Objective is something that exists independently of human consciousness and human beliefs. Radioactivity is a good example of an objective reality. It is something that exists and influences people even if people don’t know about it or believe in it. SUBJECTIVE is something that exists depending on the consciousness and beliefs of a single person. It disappears or changes if that person changes his or her beliefs. Talks about the imaginary friend that some children believe in. The imaginary friend is a subjective entity and exists only in the mind of that one child. INTER_SUBJECTIVE is something that exists within the communication network that links the subject consciousness of many individuals. If a single individual changes his/her beliefs, or even dies it is of little importance. However, if most individuals in the network die or change their beliefs then the inter-subjective phenomenon will mutate or disappear. Most of the big players are inter-subjective like gods, human rights, money, nations, etc. Inter-subjective phenomenon can be changed or destroyed but it must be done by an even larger entity.\nTouching on controversial Dr. Harami states that he is teaching history as something he believes in. If you were to ask 9 other historians to teach this course, they would all have 9 different approaches. Thus, he is saying that this couse is not definitely the “Truth” rather it is him sharing his beliefs.\nThe course can be seen on YouTube along with a plethora of interviews, reviews, opinions, and here is the introducory segment of that course.\n",
