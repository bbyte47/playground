## Dr. Yuval Harari's Sapiens: From Failed Exodus to Global Dominance

In his captivating course, "A Brief History of Humankind," Dr. Yuval Harari delves into a pivotal moment in the story of Homo sapiens: our first attempts to expand beyond our East African homeland. While an initial attempt around 100,000 years ago likely ended in failure, thwarted by encounters with the Neanderthals, something changed. A mere 30,000 years later, Sapiens were leaving Africa and rapidly spreading across the globe.

This success, Dr. Harari argues, stems from a unique cognitive revolution. But what exactly changed in our brains to fuel this transition from an unremarkable animal to the planet's apex predator? Here are some key theories and developments:

The Power of Fiction: Our unique ability to create and believe in shared myths, like religions, nations, and corporations, allows for unprecedented cooperation on a massive scale. Unlike other animals, we can collaborate in flexible groups of thousands or even millions.
The Birth of Art: Artistic creations like cave paintings and figurines suggest a shift towards symbolic thinking and rich inner worlds. These may have fostered stronger bonds and sophisticated communication within our groups.
Technological Leaps: Inventions like the needle, allowing for tailored clothing for various climates, or the development of sailing craft, played a crucial role in conquering new, harsh environments.
The Lion-Human of Hohlenstein-Stadel: This extraordinary statue, carved from mammoth ivory around 40,000 years ago, stands as a testament to our ancestors' advanced imagination. The blending of human and animal features possibly hints at early religious notions or complex storytelling traditions.

Most experts agree that the result of all these achievements came from the Cognitive revolution. Cognitive is the abilities to communicate, remember, learn, and think. History begins with the cognitive revolution.

It is speculated that around 70,000 years ago there was some minor mutation in the genetic makeup of the brain which brought the two halves together. Dr Harari emphasises that whatever this biological event was is not important. What we will discuss is the transformation of Homo sapiens was not merely biological; it was a revolution of the mind. Our capacity to weave intricate narratives, visualize the unseen, and cooperate flexibly propelled us from the middle of the food chain to the very top. We will discuss in upcoming sessions what is so special about the way sapiens think and talk and how is it so different from all other animals.
