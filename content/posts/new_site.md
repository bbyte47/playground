**New Site** picture has been generated using Stable Diffusion. This story continues from [Hugo Update](/posts/hugo_update/) and you might want to read that story before continuing with this story. While Luke's site was functional; the aesthetics left something less than pleasing. The next step was coming across a YouTube clip from Future Web Design

and he had this one short clip on generating skeleton theme using this command: hugo new theme mytheme. It then creates a minimal theme in that folder.

and this is what the site looks with just a minimal setup which included adding the theme to Hugo's config file, adding a menu, and creating a post. This is what the site looked like.

Nothing spectacular but starting to look like something that I am familiar with. Was going to start adding some style but went back to Hogo's website as I knew that users had added a large number of themes. In going through that page realized that PaperMod always seemed to be at or near the top so decided to try that one. And even at first install it looked pleasing. Also found loads of YouTube clips that used PaperMod with Hugo.

Found a YouTube clip from Renee's Workspace that I enjoyed. She did not try to come across a techno expert, rather as a person who has found something that is working for her.

Have a way to go before this site is where it needs to be. Hopefully, will find the site keeps my interest and enthusiasm. Certainly, tools such as Hugo and Netlify will make that journey easier to pursue.
