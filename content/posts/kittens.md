# Two kittens resting while looking for a home

## The beginning

It actually started a day before the above picture when the two kittens came out of the field and got with Ann. After a bit she walked to see what our back yard neighbors were up to and the kittens followed. The neighbors were willing to take the kittens in and was able to get the black one. The gray and white one got free and ran into the field.

Later on that night she got back on our porch so I brought food and whe spent the night under the concrete bench. Our cat Cleo was not pleased with this addition but left the kitten alone.

## The next day

The neighbor made a mistake by letting the black one out of her house on her way to work. By about mid morning it had found its way back to our porch. They both spent most of the afternoon sleeping on the porch. Although, when they were awake Ann focused on getting the gray one to become familiar with her and allow to be picked up.

## Found homes

That evening we bundled the kittens up in a carrier and a box and Ann carried them back to the neighbor. She didn't want the black one but welcomed the gray one. Another person was there at her house and knew someone who would take the black kitten. Ann was able to find homes for both kittens.  

Not sure why we get these strays from time to time. And all the kittens are easy to approach so must have been around people. Our Cleo was just the same way coming in our yard skin and bones. We were able to take her in and she has been a wonderful addition.
