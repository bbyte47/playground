**OpenAI** is in the news almost every day now as it appears to be one of the hottest topics in so many areas. Read an article yesterday that mentioned some of the jobs that this technology could be replacing, and teachers were mentioned numerous times in the article such as English teachers, math teachers. and science teachers just to name a few. Yet the article also suggested that there would always be a need for the personal touch such as financial advisors and medical counselors. Ever since the pandemic Zoom classes have been met with a lot of controversy so did not accept the writers feeling that teachers would get replaced with this technology.

But the underlying feeling that white collar jobs will start having pressure. Blue collar jobs are now looking more secure. Looking at the landscape believe that skill trades are looking more promising for those in high school planning their future. OpenAI is moving at such an exponential rate it is almost impossible to look at even a year much less five years but there will be a lot of changes that people will have to endure. Looking back on the last 40 or so years as manufacturing has been moved overseas blue collar jobs took the brunt of the layoffs. Now it looks like the pendulum is starting to swing and now the major impact will be on white collar jobs.

Recently signed up for a course on Udemy that covered OpenAI using their API's for GPT and DALL-E to name just two of what was going to be covered. Quickly found that these API's have a cost structure that caused me to back out of the course. Not that the cost was exorbitant but was concerned that it could lead to more expense as the course progressed. Believe there were 9 projects in the course and one of them was creating a post with images that would automatically be uploaded to a website. Another project was being able to produce a recipe with images just by inputting ingredients. Certainly, had an interest in both these projects but not enough to risk incurring costs especially ones not in my control. Later I did visit OpenAIâ€™s website and did discover that I could create a hard stop that would keep costs from spiraling so may reconsider taking the course.
