**First Post** is an introduction for this site. A key reason for starting this site is to put into practice what I have been learning concerning using Hugo. This is taken from their website: Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

Not so sure that the fun part really jumps out since there has always been enjoyment for me creating websites. For me it is more a certain type of familiarity as it reminds me of previous work with Wordpress. Just a good way to get a website up without having to jump through a lot of hoops.

Below is a Youtube video that Maximilian Schwarzmuller which does a nice job of explaining the difference between a static and dynamic website. Maximilian is part of Academind and has produced a lot of courses on Udemey some of which I have taken and enjoyed.
