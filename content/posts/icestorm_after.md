**Took some pictures** today showing more of some of the fallen limbs and even some small trees that fell. It is amazing how fast our power was restored, and the crews must work in some unsuitable weather. The power companies do a good job of bringing in crews from other areas that have not been hit. But still it is not only a hard job but there is a lot of risk involved.

The first picture shows a small pile of brush that has been cleared and readu to be burned. But the area around the burn area needs to also be cleared before burning.

This next picture shows one of the limbs that is beside the brush pile that must be cut up before burning. That wood will be saved for campfires.

At one time the area behind the brush pile had been made into a goat pen and the next two pictures show some of the limbs in that area.

And this picture is closer to the dog pen area.

At the far front end of the dog area are some rather large limbs that fell here.

This last picture shows a tree that fell on the far side of the dog area.

Will add more pictures as am able to work through these areas.
