**Hugo Site Updated** to a much newer version as it has been around 5 years since it was first installed. Actually got the idea for updating when I ran into problems with my old Hugo site where the site was loosing the backround color. I built that site back in the 2020 time frame from a course titled "JAMStack: The Complete Guide" by Ray Viljoen.

But first ran into Hugo back in 2019 and used this book

In 2020 converted the site to using the information that was gained from taking Ray's course. At times was more dedicated using the site, though until recently had moved on. In getting back with the site either due to upgrades to my hosting service or something had never picked up, the styling was becoming erratic. This was the driver to completely update the site.

After some Googling found a YouTube clip that Luke Smith had produced giving a tutorial on setting up and using Hugo.

After following this video and setting up a site locally, moved it to my hosted service. At that time it was completely bare bones. Did some more searching and was able to gain some new ideas which will be discussed in another post. This is a picture of the site after Luke's setup.
