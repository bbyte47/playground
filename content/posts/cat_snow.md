## Poem of Cat and Snow

![Cat in snow](/image/cat.png)

Upon the windowsill, a feline form

- Peers out with eyes of amber, filled with scorn
- At winter's cold embrace, the snowflakes' dance
- A symphony of white, a frigid trance

With tail held high, a regal stance it takes

- Against the icy world, its ire awakes
- Each step it takes, a paw print in the snow
- A mark of discontent, a tale of woe

The snowflakes land, soft kisses on its fur

- But shivers rack its body, a bitter stir
- It yearns for sunbeams, warmth upon its back
- For springtime's gentle touch, its rightful track

Oh, feline friend, your plight we understand

- This frozen realm, a harsh and foreign land
- But know that winter's reign will soon be o'er
- And balmy days shall grace your world once more
