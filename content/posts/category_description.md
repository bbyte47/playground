## Explanation of Categories

All of the posts have been given a Category and then from there have also had tags added to them to further give classifications. This article will give a brief explanation of the categories.

## AI LLM's

This category covers anything that touches on artificial intelligence from things like chatbots, image generators, etc. At times it is difficult to clarify a topic such as AI which can create apps that use programming languages and web frameworks which also breaks down to a language. Trying to classify anything that uses AI as this classification.

## Anthropology

This is my most favorite science as I have always been fascinated with history and when you start imagining about early human history it is awe inspiring. Imagine the first humans to reach Europe and the challenges they had to endure. Each continent has a heck of a story to tell.

## Books Read

One of my main passions is reading and am starting posting about books that I have just finished. Started off posting on books that I had finished recently although the first two books that I wrote about had been read previously also. For example, Shogun has been read multiple times. As a book is finished, will post a story about the book.

## Brief history

This category concerns a course that I took through Coursera called a "Brief History of Humankind" taught by Dr. Yuval Noah Harari of Jerusalem University. When I signed up for the course, thought that it would be heavy on Biblical history. Turned out to be completely different and became aware of concepts that were possibly lurking somewhere in my gray matter but was never able to articulate. It was quite the journey for me.

## Personal

May end up adding another category later as this is all compensating for things that have happened to me or something interesting that I want to talk about.

## Programming Languages

A computer language, also known as a programming language, is a formal language used to communicate instructions to a computer. It is used to write programs that can be executed by a computer to perform specific tasks or operations. There are many different programming languages, each with its own syntax and rules for writing code. Some popular programming languages include Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript. Some are starting to add scripts such as HTML and CSS to this group as I will do too.

## Web Development

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications. It involves various tasks such as web design, content creation, coding, and server configuration. Web developers use programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites that are functional and visually appealing. There are different types of web development, including front-end development (dealing with the user interface and user experience) and back-end development (managing the server-side logic and database interactions).
