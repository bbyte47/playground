**Livecode** is both a language and a framework and delivers executable native apps with the Livecode Virtual Machine embedded. Livecode can produce apps for Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, and Android. Plus it has a terrific IDE that runs on Windows, Mac, or Linux. And instead of syntax that uses parenthesis, brackets, or semi-colons, it codes in English.

Consider the traditional software development cycle. Youâ€™re probably familiar with it, it goes something like this: Edit, compile, run, navigate, debug, repeat. How about just edit your app live? No distractions, just: uninterrupted productivity. With the Livecode IDE you are able to run the code while also making changes which makes productivity faster and easier.

Below is an image of Livecode's IDE running on a Window 10 computer. This is the startup screen that opens when the IDE is first opened.

The next image is an app that was created to log daily notes. While the UI is nothing like what can be created with Livecode, it was easy to produce leaving the coding as the only real chore a developer has. And this app can be compiled to run on all the 3 desktops and most mobile devices. Another neat feature is that there are so many ways that a developer can use to store data. Livecode will work with most major databases including SQL and Non-SQL, files, and even the card structure Livecode is developed in. It sure has an advantage when a developer gets concerned about security and the need to limit exposure when possible.
