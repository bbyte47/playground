**Hugo Intro** is a framework for building static websites that is open source and built using golang. It has a vibrant community and over 300 themes to get you started. The build speed is amazing and it can be used on any server or your favorite CDN. You donâ€™t need any additional dependencies to run your website (no need to configure Python/PHP/Ruby or set up a database management system). It means the site can be hosted anywhere with little to no configuration at all.

You are using just the basic website tools HTML, CSS, and JaveScript. While you need to spend some time learning Hugo if you have a WordPress background there will be a lot of familiarity just not having to learn PHP. With Hugo you will need to learn the concepts and templating system. But you don't need to become a Go expert to begin using this SSG.

Thanks to the community there are a lots of pre-baked templates and many useful tools like starter kits, frontends, search engines, and many others. Below is a video on Youtube that talks about Hugo by Eric Murphy who does a good job of introducing Hugo.
