**Using App on Digital Ocean** is a newer service that they have started where it is possible to build, deploy, manage, and scale apps. Digital Ocean handles the infastructure, app runtimes, so that code can be pushed to production in just a few clicks. It has support for Node.js. Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, Static sites, and Docker.

While this site is not on Digital Ocean it could be and Digital Ocean uses GitHub's repositories to be able to push updates to the site all in a few clicks much like what I did with Netlify. I watched a tutorial on YouTube that Chris did for Digital Ocean where he created a Laravel project and deployed it to the App platform. Below is the tutorial:
