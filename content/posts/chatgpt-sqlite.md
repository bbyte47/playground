**Creating a Todo app** with Electron using SQLite as the database. Have taken several courses on Electron from Udemey and done the walk-through tutorial that the Electron site has. The tutorial did a nice job of not only being easy to follow but also worked and was able to create a desktop app for Windows 11 that would open to a Hello page.

Then decided to do a simple Todo app as it is something that so many people include in their training portfolio as it does have something that uses CRUD and displays data. As I was sticking with Electron tried to search for examples using both Google and YouTube with not a lot of success. It could have been that I was looking for examples using SQLite as the database. Was kind of stuck on SQLite as it is something that I am familiar with and works well with this type of project. Did find a resource on YouTube but started getting ino issues and the work arounds started becoming a headache.

Thought of ChatGPT and using the 4.0 version asked to produce the script for a Todo app using Electron and SQLite as the database. After about 3 iterations it was able to produce a working app. Wow! Not only did I have a working app but now can use it as a reference for other projects. Am excited to be learning and using Electron as it has so many features that are useful for the desktop.
