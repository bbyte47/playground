# A roof-over system added to our mobile home

![Mobile Home](/image/Intro.JPG)

## Getting prepared

It started on Monday July 8th when Todd, a family friend, came over with his leaf blower. He got up on the roof and cut all the branches that were touching the home which turned out to be more than expected. Then he removed the flashing from the roof to the porch.

And completed by blowing off all the pine needles that had accumulated on the roofs.

## Storm

We were fortunate that the prep work was done on Monday as the hurrican Beryl made its way into Indiana. We did get rain on Tuesday light in the most cases seeming to rain all day. On WEdnesdat Beryl was here with heavy rain all day. But by Thursday morning it had moved on and it was a pleasant dat for the roof addition.

## Process

The installers got here right at 8AM and was a 3 man crew with two on the roof and the 3rd on the ground. As this is a roof-over system there is not a need to replace or remove shingles. So the prep work moved fairly quickly and they were adding the system in short order.

## Finished

By about 2:30PM they were finished. The system consists of insulation and then metal roofing. Over the years they have tried different colors but have ended up going with just white as that has held up better. The roof is guaranteed to last the life of the home. In the short time since the roof has been installed we have had several heavy rain storms with there being no problems making us satisfied in choosing this system.
