## Foreword

This is another book that I consumed audibly and believe that this particular book was lessened due to the recording. Possibly, if had read the book would have had a different take on it. Am comfortable in all the different types of media from print, digital, and audible. They all have different benefits and I switch between all three; at the moment more focused on audible. Found the book okay but not one that I would ever read again.

## Introduction:
