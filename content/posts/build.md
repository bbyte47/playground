# Bottom Line

Found this YouTube course a joy to work through as it used so much of the initial installed Laravel platform code. The only new file that was created being a Controller file. Having already worked through most of the versioning changes, did not run into any problems there. Since the course starts out with the understanding that there is already an existing Laravel environment, made sure to install a Laravel 10 platform rather than the current Laravel 11 one as it will not run on PHP 8.1 or lower where Laravel 10 will. Found the project easy to create within minimal time.
