**Post Addition** is some documentation for add content to this site. A real simple way for doing this is using something like Netlify along with GitHub and a new post is automatically uploaded and published once the post is saved in the local text editor or it can be tied in with Netlify CMS and a post can be created live and pushed back to the GitHub repository and the local site.

Have used Netlify and found it to be a really good resource but wanted to just use the hosted site that I have used for years and also didn't want to make it too complicated. So I setup the Hugo generator locally and created this site and everytime I add a post just run the Hugo command to create the public folder and then transfer it to the hosted site.

Obviously this works but it does add a lot more effort and also the opportunity to loose data if my home system crashes and I forget to backup my drive. But this is still a fairly simple way to add a post. This folder is used on a Virtalbox machine called Hugo and the folder is maggodee1.
