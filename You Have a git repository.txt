You: Have a git repository that I use two computers with at times. Both computers have a main and develop branch. On this computer when I open vscode on the app am in the develop branch and it shows pending changes that I don't care about now. I want to pull the repository "origin" and make it overwrite both the main and develop branches on this computer so that these barnches match what is in the repository..
Assistant: Got it! To ensure that your local branches (`main` and `develop`) exactly match those on the remote repository (`origin`), you'll need to perform a few steps. Be cautious, as these steps will overwrite any local changes you have.

### Steps to Reset `main` and `develop` Branches:

1. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:**
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. **Reset the `main` branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard origin/main
   ```

3. **Reset the `develop` branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git reset --hard origin/develop
   ```

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Open your terminal in VSCode or your preferred terminal application.**
. **Fetch the latest changes:**
   ```sh
   git fetch origin
   ```
   This command fetches the updates from the remote repository without merging them into your local branches.

3. **Reset the `main` branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout main      # Switch to the main branch
   git reset --hard origin/main  # Reset it to match the remote main branch
   ```
   The `--hard` option will overwrite your local files with the files from the remote branch. This command will remove all local changes in the `main` branch.

4. **Reset the `develop` branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout develop      # Switch to the develop branch
   git reset --hard origin/develop  # Reset it to match the remote develop branch
   ```
   Similar to the `main` branch reset, this will ensure your `develop` branch matches the remote repository.

### Important Notes:
- **Backup Important Changes:** If you have any changes that you might need later, consider stashing them using `git stash` before resetting:
  ```sh
  git stash
  ```
- **Uncommitted Changes:** Any uncommitted changes will be lost with the `--hard` reset, so be sure you don't need them before running these commands.

This should ensure that both your `main` and `develop` branches are up-to-date with the remote `origin`. If you need any further assistance or run into issues, feel free to ask!
